# 🚀 BuzzFeed Quiz Clone with Angular

Welcome to the **BuzzFeed Quiz Clone** project! This project is part of a challenge from the **Deal - Spring Boot and Angular +17** bootcamp by **DIO**. The challenge, titled **"Creating a BuzzFeed Clone with Angular"**, was an opportunity to enhance my skills in **Angular**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. 🎉

## 📖 About the Project

This project is a **dynamic quiz application** inspired by BuzzFeed's famous quizzes. Instead of guessing what superhero you are, this quiz helps you discover **what kind of developer you could be**! Depending on your answers, the quiz will deliver multiple possible results, offering insights into whether you'd be a Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Game Developer, or even... well, maybe programming isn’t for you 😅.

## 🔍 Features

- **Dynamic Questioning**: A set of interactive questions that adapts based on your choices.
- **Multiple Outcomes**: With various developer types as potential results, including Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, Game Developer, and more.
- **Simple Algorithm**: An internal database sums up the user's responses to provide a final result based on their answers.
- **Built with Angular**: Leveraging **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for a smooth and responsive user experience.
